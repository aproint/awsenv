Trouble remembering the right AWS profile or region in specific projects?
`.awsenv` comes to the rescue.
Every time you switch to a directory with `.awsenv` file, its AWS environment variables load automatically.
Profit.

toc::[]

== Motivation
When you work with multiple AWS accounts, you'll find yourself juggling with various AWS profiles.
You'd use `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to switch the profile or you'd use `--profile` argument in AWS CLI commands.

_It's super easy to forget to switch the profile._

The common case is you're using a single profile in particular directories.
Having a file which defines the profile and other AWS environment variables together with a mechanism how to auto-load them gives you a better control over the access to AWS.

The file itself is pretty simple:

..awsenv
[source]
----
# You can use comments
AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
----

We support the variables defined in the official AWS documentation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html[Environment Variables To Configure the AWS CLI^].

== Installation
`.awsenv` is almost POSIX-compliant and it should work in the most of the major contemporary shells.
It was tested in `zsh` and `bash`.

=== Oh My ZSH
. Clone this repository into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/aproint/awsenv.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/awsenv
----
. Activate the plugin in `~/.zshrc`:
+
[source]
----
plugins=( [plugins...] awsenv)
----
. Reopen your terminal
+
NOTE: This installation enables the hook automatically

=== Other Shells
. Clone this repository into `~/.awsenv` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/aproint/awsenv.git ${HOME}/.awsenv
----
. Source the script in your shell profile, i.e. `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`:
+
[source]
----
source ${HOME}/.awsenv/awsenv.sh
----
+
- *Bash* change directory hook
+
Source the hook script after the `awsenv.sh` script in the shell profile:
+
[source]
----
source ${HOME}/.awsenv/bash-awsenv.sh
----
- *ZSH* change directory hook
+
If you're not using Oh My ZSH, you can source the hook script after the `awsenv.sh` script in the shell profile manually:
+
[source]
----
source ${HOME}/.awsenv/zsh-awsenv.sh
----
. Reopen your terminal

== Usage
The script defines two commands `awsenv` and `awsenvclr`.

. `awsenv` - execute in a directory with `.awsenv` file to load its AWS environment variables
. `awsenvclr` - unsets all AWS environment variables; this is a convenience command when you feel your env variables got mixed up.

=== Auto-load when changing directory
Thanks to the deeper shell integration with a hook script, it's possible to execute `awsenv` on every directory change automatically and thus switch your AWS environment variables seamlessly.
See the installation details.

IMPORTANT: The hooks work only in interactive shell sessions.

=== How does `awsenv` command work?
. It searches for a `.awsenv` file in the current directory; if it can't find the file, it looks a level up in the directory hierarchy recursively until it's found (or not).
. If `awsenv` is not active, it stores the current AWS environment variables into `AWSENV_PREV_` equivalents (aka history).
. It sources the `.awsenv` file into your current shell session.
+
IMPORTANT: `awsenv` filters out anything but `AWS_` prefixed environment variables.
. When you change to a directory
+
- without `.awsenv` file in its parent hierarchy, it loads your previous AWS environment variables from `AWSENV_PREV_` and clears the history.
+
- with another `.awsenv` file, it loads the new AWS environment variables, but it doesn't overwrite the history.
